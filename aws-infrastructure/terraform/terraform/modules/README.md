# Terragrunt

These modules are written to be used via terragrunt. See the root README.md.

# `terraform fmt`

The Terraform modules in this repo are formatted using the `terraform fmt`
command. Your editor may have a plugin to support automatically formatting them,
or you can alternatively just run `terraform fmt` from the commandline.

# Sources

Some of the EKS terraform config is based on https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples/eks-getting-started
